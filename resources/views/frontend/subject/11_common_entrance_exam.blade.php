                                                    to school, not just region to region. Also bear in mind
                                                    that schools may change the
                                                    examiner they use, so do keep checking. Look not just at
                                                    the exam board, but
                                                    subject, format, length of test and any additional tests
                                                    set by that school (such as
                                                    creative writing).
